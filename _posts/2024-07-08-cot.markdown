We leverage single-cell chromatin accessibility data from 559 healthy cell subsets to predict the cell of transformation (COT) across 36 cancer subtypes, providing unprecedented scale and resolution into the cellular beginnings of cancers. Slides presented at the Mount Sinai Cancer Biology Retreat.
