Course final project. We analyzed the model from that simulates the progression of a heterogeneous population of cells towards cellular senescence. The model we analyze considers proliferative, growth-arrested, apoptotic, and senescent cells, but makes the simplifying assumption that growth-arrested cells do not transition back to the proliferative state. In an attempt to make the model more realistic, we extend it to allow such a scenario and model the transition using a uniform probability distribution.
