Course final project. We reproduce the workflow outlined by [Fang et al. 2013](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39482-9_3) to classify aging genes as DNA repair versus non DNA repair genes using updated data. The end goal was not to perform classification on new instances, but instead to perform feature selection in order to better understand what attributes of aging genes make them DNA repair vs non DNA repair related.
