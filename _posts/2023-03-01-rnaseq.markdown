We carry out a systematic meta-analysis of over 1200 bulk RNA sequencing (RNASeq) samples obtained from 74 peer-reviewed publications on aging-related transcriptomic changes in C. elegans. Using both differential expression analyses and machine learning approaches, we mine the pooled data for novel pro-longevity genes.
